## Pre-Requisites

The following steps only need to be done once per machine:

1. Ensure that [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) is installed.
2. Ensure that [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) is installed by running `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
3. Ensure that [Bower](http://bower.io) is installed by running `npm install -g bower`.

## Building

The following needs to be done whenever you're going to start working on the site:

1. Open Terminal and type `cd` then a space, drag your repository folder into Terminal and press `return`.
2. Run `npm install` to ensure the required dependencies are installed.
3. Run `bower install` to ensure the required dependencies are installed.
4. Run `grunt` to build the site for development or `grunt build` to build the site for deploying.

Note: As a shortcut, you can run this single command to do steps 2-4:
